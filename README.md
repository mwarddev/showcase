## Design (UXD)

### Strategy

#### Project Goal
Create a platform for artists to display their talent and receive feedback in the form of comments and likes.

* __Is the content culturally appropriate?__
  * Yes. All content is supplied by users.
* __Is the content relevant?__
  * Yes. The content supplied is specific to the site's goal.
* __Can we track and catalogue the content in an intuitive way?__
  * Yes. All content is stored in a database and is created using forms.
* __Is the technology appropriate?__
  * Yes. Django was designed for creating full stack sites and apps.
* __Why are we so special? What sets us appart?__
  * Most artists tend to use social media to display their work, this platform is specifically designed for artists and clients that appreciate the content of the site.
* __Tech considerations?__
  * The site will be built with Python + Django, using class based views, HTML templates, Bootstrap to handle responsiveness and styling, CSS to handle custom styling, JavaScript to handle timeout functions and CDNs, and PostgreSQL for the database.
